22-05-20 SM: News just in... Jebetto has been seen in a full set of Empire Armour. Apparently the king has granted him his own estate somewhere in the Empire.. I wonder if this is going to cause a relationship breakdown between the Clovis and Empire.

22-05-19 SM: So its alot of work for something that you dont use alot.
22-05-19 SM: Issue is with a campaign you only use a map once or twice.
22-05-19 RN: I'm thinking tiles
22-05-19 SM: I prefer tiles or paper maps.
22-05-19 SM: Battlefield depends on numerous factors
22-05-19 SM: Tbh... imo.. simple maps are fine. I agree with your bro... a rabbit hole I personally dont wanna go down
22-05-19 SM: Finally... a Kenku ritual has gone horribly wrong.... the Kyrn sent a small force to assist them... however, the Kenku refused to accept assistance from outsiders...

However, both rifts were compromised when the Archmages in each respective state brought through some beholders and were quickly killed. At present both rifts remain open and numerous monster siting have been reported, more concerning is that some of the beats have never been seen before in wildemount.
22-05-17 SM: In other news. Concerning reports have emerged regarding 4 dragons fighting abover the Empires and Kyrn Boarder. It was reports that a Red and Black Dragon were protecting the Empire forces and a Blue and Gold dragon were defending the Kyrn's. Little is known regarding the dragons motives at this stage.

22-05-17 TM: Sounds good
22-05-16 SM: Only 1 set of stats etc though
22-05-16 SM: Yeah thats fine. Outline it in background
22-05-16 TM: Can I still have a split personality if it is on one character sheet?. Keeps same class etc. But I can add to the description section so could have character identify as a different person.(name, personality/flaws could change). Got an idea for backstory with it.
22-05-16 SM: New book released as well guys
22-05-16 SM: No. Due to issues with dnd beyond
22-05-16 SM: +1, +1, +1
22-05-16 TM: I thought it could be really fun to play
22-05-16 BD: You would think of that
22-05-16 BD: lizard dude reacted ð to your message 
22-05-16 TM: @Scott McNeill can I make a split personality character. Will have 2 character sheets - both share the same race, stat block, equipment (anything physical) but each can have a different class, traits, flaws etc. With swapping between the two I thought rolling after each rest to see which personality is dominant - or dm could also have control of it
22-05-16 BD: Additionally we have to choose its language. You happy with dwarvish?
22-05-16 BD: @Scott McNeill I want to go Duergar for my Cleric but we have to choose the Ability Modifiers for the race. The choices are +1/+1/+1 to three different abilities or +2/+1 to two. Are you happy with Str +2 and Wis +1?
22-05-16 SM: Or ill make rules without you
22-05-16 SM: Get online
22-05-16 SM: Ok boyz
