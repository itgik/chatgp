22-05-16 SM: The Adventurers were betrayed by a Bard known as Jebetto. Jebetto betrayed Sir D and the mercenary company. Enlisting Zahir Vampires to turn on his fellow companions. After the Battle, Jebetto returned to Port Dalami, ransacked the partys guild hall, assisted a number of the high elfs slaves (dwarfs) escape port dalami and took a airship and remains at large. This betrayal has spread across all of wildemount. The Empire, Kyrn and Clovus all consider Jebetto and Enemy of the state and offer a substantial reward if the bard can be brought to justice. Caution should be taken when dealing with this individual.....
22-05-16 SM: (2 months have passed since the events that took place last night). The Clovus Concord has officially announced that Port Dalami is under complete lockdown. Following the successful Assassination attempt of a high priest of Avandra. It was known that the high priest had almost unlocked a cure to the plague that befell the high elf population of Port Dalami. Unfortunately due to the Assassination, the plague continued to spread that lead to the death of 22,000 high elfs. Therefore, Port Dalami will no longer be open for visitors, or individuals leaving the port. The Clovus is currently relocating resources to another major city. Details will be released when future  plans are consolidated. It is with a Heavy heart that we also report the Death of Sir D and his men. They were ambushed by a local Vampire Coven, and killed in cold blood. The Clovus sent a air fleet and burnt the viÄºlage and occupants in the Area, however, remaims are yet to be found of Count Vakna. The Blood Hunters guild constructed a memorial for Sir D and a mercenary company that risked their lives and Unfortunately met their demise trying to protect the lives of the villagers.
22-05-16 SM: I have big plan for Jebetto
22-05-16 TM: I've ruined bards for @everyone

22-05-16 SM: So tonight about 2030 we'll jump on discord.
22-05-16 SM: Ok boys
22-05-15 TM: For questing I have a suggestion, you guys willing to chip in like $5 a month each towards Scotts premium cost. Then the leftover can save up to purchase new sources when they come out

22-05-15 RN: Gold equivalent or equipment of equal value?
22-05-15 SM: Also a spy will fill you in on the previous partys heroics and why Jebetto is now wanted.
22-05-15 SM: In essence, even though you died We can keep current exp and Gold equivalent. Just with new characters

22-05-15 SM: Nope those characters are Jebettos
22-05-15 JP: Clovus is where we were? Empire is the orcs and other outcasty type races and the Kyrn is the human/dwarven alliance?
22-05-15 SM: Also Jebettos guild currently is wanted for high treason by the Clovus and Sir D will be personally leading a force to track them down
22-05-15 BD: This poll is no longer available.
22-05-15 SM: I have the next two night off work so we can do a discord tomorrow night to discuss the reset. I will still use all current storylines, they will be intergrated into future world events.
