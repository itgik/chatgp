22-04-23 SM: @everyone
22-04-23 SM: Jebeddoâs Vision: A great feast in underway and a cute gnome bard is currently performing for the croud. Jebeddoâs performance is next as he walks up and is performing the gig of his life, he is overcome with a strange feeling and suddenly forgets how to play his bagpipes... his nose begins to bleed and in the corner of his eye he sees the cute gnomeâs eyes glowing with cruel intent. Suddenly the croud start mocking Jebeddo for his height hurling insults such as â Your so short that you donât know if you have a headache or footacheâ, âyour so short that if you pulled up your socks youâd be blindâ âyour so short you could bungee jump of a curbâ. Jebeddo heartbroken leaves the stage and finds a note... it states... âNever, Ever, Upstage a Dragonâ....
22-04-23 SM: Norixius Balasarâs Vision: The vision opens with the shine of a beautifully crafted set of Dragon Armour. Arkhan the Cruel a mighty Dragonborn, has just slain one of the champions of Bahamut. The Ambush took place on one of the revelry vessels that had agreed to smuggle a number of Bahamut priests to the coast to assist with spreading the word and teachings of Bahamut. Arkhan took the body of the Champion and mounted the body on the front of the ship to make an example of the battle and demonstrate his prowess in battle.
22-04-23 SM: Ezerieâs Vision: Ezerieâs vision takes place in the streets of an unknown city. The young Aarakocra is covered in dirt and is met by a friendly urchin. Ezerie had just recently taken a trinket by a noble class Aarakocra Champion, however, is found.The Urchin attempts to protect Ezerie and is beaten badly... Ezerie is also beaten and the trinket is converscated. Into the Vision the Aarakocra gaze comes into view. A set of goggles on the head of the individual glisten in the sun.... âhe leans down to the young Aarakocra and says.... âif you wish to survive, then you need to fight for what you believe inâ.. Or... âAdapt and learn new skills that will take others off guardâ. The champion leaves and the Urchin approaches Ezerie and states..... lets go teach you how to become strong.
22-04-23 SM: Bobbin Furyweedâs Vision: Bobbinâs eyeâs are firmly fixated on the beautiful dagger that was fastened to the belt of this beautiful woman. Bobbin realises that there is 3 guards that are heavily armored and would easily make short work of the rogue. Bobbin attempts to persuade the lady, things are going quite well when suddenly he makes a joke about moving the conversation to the bedroom. The woman places a curse on Bobbin and he is unable to speak. She whispers âonly a fool would attempt to seduce meâ.  Perhaps you might seek me out again and we can have another âdiscussionâ.... when you have learned to train your tongue in a more âelegantâ dialect. Bobbin blacks out as the butt of a short sword hits him in the skull.
22-04-23 SM: Sanguanâs Vision: During the Tieflings time at the temple he was subjected to many rituals that allowed him to achieve the ability to turn into a Lycan. However, this didnât come without a price. Sanguanâs ability infuriated the order of the rival vampire clan. The vision shows Sanguan witnessing Count VakNika, killing 6 Blood Hunters during a hunt that went south, when the hunters were ambushed. Count VakNika spared Sanguan so that he could warn the order that the power of the Vampire Coven was continuing to grow and would soon turn to make examples of the Blood Hunters once and for all.
22-04-23 SM: During the Encounter with the Mind Flayer during the telekinetic link each of the party's minds were interconnected. During this time each of you weâre subjected to one anotherâs past. You each see visions that have shaped the past of each memberâs standing before you.
