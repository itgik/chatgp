22-04-07 MH: I still want someone to finish Jace Beleren Must Die.
22-04-07 JP: You have to âbeâ the character, like identify with them, who they are, where theyâve been, what are their dreams and aspirations - and I want to have a voice for mine (donât think this is essential) - @Rohan Northey I think would like us to dress like our characters
22-04-07 JP: Iâve learnt heaps, Iâm going to be way better now
22-04-07 JP: You should watch critical role
22-04-07 JP: Iâve got one you can borrow, think @Scott McNeill has one too
