23-03-21 TM: I asked for this. For a half elf sorceress , charisma 20 and has Fey Ancestry. Chat GPT turned it into this My half-elf sorceress stands tall and proud, donning a suit of gleaming mithril half-plate armor. The metal plates are expertly crafted, fitting snugly against her body while allowing her to move with ease. The armor shimmers with a bright, silvery glow, reflecting the ambient light in a dazzling display. Her long hair flows freely behind her, with strands of it catching the light and glistening like spun gold. Despite the weight of the armor, she appears graceful and poised, with an air of confidence and determination about her. Her hands rest lightly on the hilt of her sword, ready for any challenge that may come her way
