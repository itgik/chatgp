It would depend on how great the threat. But I would be open to consulting the empire to avoid the annihilation  of our world.
22-11-25 SM: Hey all. Its Foxy Roxy here.... reports are in... throughout all wildemount there are numerous reports of individuals that have gone into A coma... there is no way of waking them. Reports have been made that after 7 days the individuals disappear without a trace.

We have just seven days to stop the process of Ceremorphosis.... if time expires it is likely mini will either die or be transformed into a mature illithid..... the Clerics were able to locate the parasite, fortunately it hasn't reached Sarouks brain stem. We believe that the parasite was implanted when he was asleep prior to the battle with the empire. The clerics have constructed a device that will allow a party to travel into minis mind and provide  support for him while the surgery is conducted by the clerics..... poor mini...

22-10-23 SM: Attention all..... its Foxy Roxy with a very important tiny hunt talk!!!!!!! The Clerics have uncovered whats wrong with mini..... he has become the host of a illithid tadpole. We have just seven days to stop the process of Ceremorphosis.... if time expires it is likely mini will either die or be transformed into a mature illithid..... the Clerics were able to locate the parasite, fortunately it hasn't reached Sarouks brain stem. We believe that the parasite was implanted when he was asleep prior to the battle with the empire. The clerics have constructed a device that will allow a party to travel into minis mind and provide  support for him while the surgery is conducted by the clerics..... poor mini...
