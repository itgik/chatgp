22-08-21 SM: See tiny hut talk for details
22-08-21 SM: Good morning Adventurers. Its that time for another Tiny Hutt talk from me Foxi Roxi. Starting off today with sad news. Sarouk currently remains in a coma... unfortunately the Cleric are unsure how to revive The great general. However, they report his condition remains stable. Lady De Rogna is still held captive and is resisting all efforts to extract information from her. Throughout wildemount a strange cloud has formed above the continent. Meteors have been falling from the sky and strange extraterrestrial lifeforms have been emerging from the strike zones. The Kyrn intelligence division were able to find some strange crystals and have developed a ship that is said can travel into the cosmos. The Bright Queen is requesting interested individuals volunteer to be the first spelljammers to explore the stars! Thats it for now. As always im Foxy Roxi.. here to give you the goss with the gift of my gab.

22-07-24 SM: Furthermore. It is said the force is being lead by Lady De Rogna of the Cerberus  Assembly and has armed herself with a relic. Fortunately on the previous mission undertaken by Centre Stage... we were able to gather important information regarding key positions on the battlefield and will have time to deploy  stragically advantageous positions.
22-07-24 SM: A drow interrupts Sarouk and the Bright Queen. Excuse me and pardon the intrusion... ' we have received word that the Empire have 3 very large monstrosities amoung the oncoming army... it is believed that the Dwarfs have equiped them with projectile weaponary... in addition to this we have recieved word that the Clovus Concord supply routes have been heavily hit by the Empire... Foxy Roxi and Schultz's teams were only partly successful... while they did wipe out the invaders, the Kyrns will suffer a +150% increase in item price for 3 months while they rebuild their stock.

22-07-23 SM: Ill update quest list tonight and we shall vote tonight if were going to do immediate alert or tackle a regular quest.
22-07-23 SM: Hey Y'all. An important Tiny Hut talk today... a large scale Dwendilan Force has been sighted to the Southeast of Bladegarden and has set it's sights on the Ashguard Garrison. We have lost contact with Kyrn forces at Bladegarden and are concerned that in the coming days the Empire will attempt to secure the Ashguard Garrison, cutting off Xhorhas from the Marrow Vally. If the Empire succeeds than this may impact the Kyrns ability to communicate with the clovus concord and will give the Empire a well fortified position and potentially allow for Empire forces to commence raiding partys in Xhorhas. The Bright Queen is sending 20,000 soldiers to the front line that will be lead by Sarouk. She has also committed seige weaponry to the cause. However, the Empire also has large beasts that they are controlling.... Centre Stage has been requested to send its members to lead units in the battle and Assist Sarouk with preparations for the coming battle. The Clovus Concord have also met heavy resistance in the southern ocean... The empire has deployed numerous 'strike forces that have infiltrated Clovus encampments that also pose a threat to supply lines critical to the Kyrn Cause. Schultz and myself (Foxy Roxi) have been tasked to seek out the strike teams and prevent further damage to the Supply lines and could use some help.
22-07-23 SM: If you dont attempt it time will move normally. Its like and epic quest.
22-07-23 SM: It will still move time as well and will count as 2 mission timeframe.
22-07-23 SM: Ok Tiny Hutt talk coming soon quick DM meta chat. The THT is going to present you all with and option. Its a new mechanic that I have made. Its called an immediate alert. Basically you have two options. You must attempt the event or the world will change. However, this may work both ways. Perhaps you may want an event to happen so that somethibg else changes.
22-07-23 TM: D'Duf wants to work to help repair the telescope he found. I think it will be useful in raids etc
22-07-23 TM: While I am not there - Jepetto wants to find out more about Dalami. The best way to raid it (also while he is trying that for his back story he is also looking for his orc parents that went missing there)
22-07-23 SM: Also. Very quick tiny hut talk.
22-07-23 SM: Can you all decide on what you wanna do because the next few require some prep work beforehand.
22-07-23 SM: Im going to send out the quest list guys.
22-07-22 JP: Yeah!!!
