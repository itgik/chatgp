22-07-06 SM: Any questions regarding Tiny Hut Talk.
22-07-06 SM: Hey hey hey... its that tine. Foxi Roxi here with the Tiny Hut talk. Jabetto has made a public address to the Empire today... pay respects to his former party members. He outline how the party we're all very close and endured many hardships together. Jabetto also suggested that the party were kidnapped by the Kyrns and assassinated in cold blood. Empire officials have made a promise to send out bounty hunters to track the members of Center Stage and bring justice to the heros. The Bright queen has been saddened by the news of one of her sons that were captured and killed by the empire last week. Prince Kalim and his party were charged with the assassination of the Mayor of Blumenthal. The Empire has taken the body of the prince and other party memebers and placed their corpses on the kingdom walls of Rexxentrum as a reminder to all Kyrns how oppose the Empire. A strange island can be seen floating in the sky to the west of Fevergulf Lake. It is now completely sealed in darkness and individuals should be cautious when travelling thoughout this region. Time is running out for the intruders stuck in Rexxentrum.... the Empire have new leads about their location. Finally the Empire has set out an expedition force to secure the Relic responsible for the Arcane Explosion... hope it doesnt fall into the wrong hands... not much good news to report this week... thats depressing.... as always im Foxi Roxi here to give you the goss... with the gift of my Gap. Stay safe everyone....

22-06-25 RN: My lords! My ladies. And everyone else here not sitting on a cushion!  Today....today....you find yourselves equals. For you are all equally blessed. For I have the pride, the privilege, nay, the pleasure....of introducing you to a party founded by hero's who were sired by hero's . A party who can trace there lineage back beyond the great calamity. I first met them atop an air ship near the near the Dwendalyn empire, defending this land, and crushing champions that never stood a chance. Next, they amazed me further still in Roshana where they out drunk an orc horde. In the lands of the kyrnn, they solved civil unrest amongst Kobolds. And so, without further gilding the lily, jerkin the gherkin and with no more further ado, I give to you, the crushers of chastity, the meddlers of mind flayers, the protectors of the realm, the one, the only, the Justus league of  CENTRESTAGE!!
