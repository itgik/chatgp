22-05-29 SM: Hey hey its Tiny  Hut Time with Foxy Roxi. A local factory has been sealed off to residents in Rosohna. A strange imp can be seen on the top of the factory yelling out this message. Welcome to 'Hilly Bonkers' Alchemy Factory, do you dare to try your luck playing with fire, those that succeed will be greatly rewarded, however, those that fail may get turned into   goblin gobble goks.... who is game enough?.
22-05-29 SM: *Somewhere in Empire Territory. Barlok opens his eyes and finds himself in a dungeon. The rest of his party lay unconscious on the floor. Barlok hears footsteps approaching. A figure appears and the cell do opens. Before Barlok could react his body is levitated and thrown against the wall. The impact causing his nose to start bleeding. He realises that Lady De Rogna is infront of him. She smirks and is holding an item in her hand. She says 'Thank you for uncovering the relic that we have been searching for. Uk'otoa is one step closer towards reappearing in this plain and soon we shall reclaim dominance over the oceans and Crush the Kyrns.

22-05-22 SM: 'Your Soul is Mine'
22-05-22 SM: *Somewhere to the south of Xhorhas, Near the Boarder of Clovus land. Dee Vil and his crew stumble upon a temple hidden in deep foliage. Dee Vil uses his hand to warn his party to make no noise. They can see a large Ziggurat in the Centre of the area. A large Black Dragon suddenly lands to the left of the Ziggurat and Drops Four Corpses onto the ground. Four Vampires walk out and collect the bodys and place them on a Altar. Dee Vil takes out his spying glass and focuses on the Altar. Count Vakna walks out of the Ziggurat and addresses his Kin. 'Brothers today we pay tribute to 'the whispered one', 'the dying king', our 'Lord of the Rotted Tower'.... We offer 'The Champions of the Clovis' in the name of Vecna! May he grant them Eternal life so they can do his bidding. Count Vakna, plunges his blade into the chests of the fallen warriors and Dee Vil watches as the Ziggurat fires a green beam into the eyes of the lifeless bodys. Suddently they start to move. The first body that rises is an Aarakora monk, followed by a Dragonborn, Dee Vil next witnesses a tiefling start to move.... finally a halfling stands to its feet. Count Vakna yells 'For Vecna'. The last thing Dee Vil sees is the Champions Kneel. Suddenly De vils party is covered by a Surge of Acid Breath from the Black Dragon. The vision stone rolls from De Vils lifeless hand... last last vision seen is De Vils cold Stare as the Acid continues to burn into his flesh.

22-05-22 SM: *You all see the Continent of wildemount on the horizon. As the Airship starts to approach the land.  The Bards start to sing. You  hear the thumping of the wardrums. *through the clouds the first Empire Airship appears......
22-05-22 SM: Dont worry though Roxi will be back soon ;)
22-05-22 SM: (DM talk) this will be the last Foxy Roxi Tiny Hut talk. I suggest you all write down some of the key points that Roxi has shared. All events she has shared will have quests linked to each of them. I wont be prompting you when we play. The information shared is documented, however, its up to you all how you want to move forward and what you believe is the most important tasks you should complete. Some quests are time sensitive and if they aren't completed in a certain timeframe this will directly effect the world moving forward. We're really turning it up a notch. I also have some exciting new friends/enemies for you all and can't wait to share what I have prepared.
22-05-22 TM: Put me down for Random Scrolls :)
22-05-22 SM: Finally. The Empire is hitting food supply chains between the clovus and Kyrn lands due to the wildfire that's still out of control.... these raids need to be stopped or we may see a hike in food prices and limited resources in the coming months. As always im Foxy Roxi... here to give you the gos with the gift of my gab. Excuse me while I continue my joy flight with the dragon :)
22-05-22 SM: The village that was flooded by the Empire has been overrun by monsters. The water is subsiding.... im sure there may be survivers and loot left behind thats there for the taking... perhaps this task may be best tackled by some stealthy lads that can avoid the threat.
22-05-22 SM: In other news. Yorgi the mage is selling random unidentified spell scroll on a discount. Want to play some spell roulette... well now is your chance.
22-05-22 SM: Hey y'all. Its Foxy Roxi. Today im currently flying on the back of the Blue Dragon. She was kind enough to let me survey some of the Empires territory. The Blue and Gold Dragons are willing to work with the Kyrn's. Perhaps a band of adventurous individuals may be willing to visit the lairs of the Dragons to assist them with some missions and learn what the Red and Black Dragons are planning...
22-05-22 SM: Foxy Roxi is currently engaged in an infiltration mission. Later today she will give a tiny hut talk regarding what she has discovered.
